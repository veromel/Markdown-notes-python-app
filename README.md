## Application Description

This is a simple notes application that allows you to:

- Save, edit, retrieve, and delete notes.
- Check the grammar of the content you are writing.

The application is structured with a hexagonal architecture for practice purposes. It also comes with Docker to facilitate local installation and execution on any machine. Docker will also start a local MongoDB database where the notes you create will be stored. All dependencies are managed through **Poetry**.

## Architecture

The application follows a **Hexagonal Architecture** (also known as Ports and Adapters) with the following components:

- **Domain Layer**: Contains the core business logic with entities, value objects, and repository interfaces.
- **Application Layer**: Implements use cases through services that orchestrate the domain objects.
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Provides concrete implementations for external concerns like databases and APIs.

### Key Features:

- **Dependency Injection**: Utilizes the `inject` library to manage dependencies, making the code more testable and maintainable.
- **Value Objects**: Implements domain concepts as immutable objects with built-in validation.
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracts data access behind interfaces, allowing for different implementations.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Uses Motor for asynchronous MongoDB access with proper UUID handling.

## How to Download and Run the Application

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/veromel/Markdown-notes-python-app.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. **Start Docker from the terminal:**

   Make sure Docker is installed and running:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

3. **Open the interface:**

   - Open the `index.html` file in a **Firefox** browser.
   - Note: Currently, it does not work properly in Chrome due to certain compatibility issues.

## API Testing with Postman

To test the API, you can use the Postman collection included in the project:

- [Download Postman Collection](Markdown_notes_app.postman_collection.json)

You can import this collection into Postman to easily interact with the API endpoints defined.

### Importing into Postman

1. Open Postman.
2. Click on `Import` in the top left corner.
3. Select `Upload Files`.
4. Choose `Markdown_notes_app.postman_collection.json` from the project root directory.

Once imported, you'll be able to test various functionalities such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting notes using the endpoints provided.

## Run Tests

The application includes both unit tests and integration tests to ensure code quality and functionality.

### Run Unit Tests

Run the unit tests to verify individual components:

```bash
pytest tests/unit -v
```

### Run Integration Tests

Run integration tests to verify the application works correctly with MongoDB:

```bash
pytest tests/integration -v
```

### Run All Tests

Run all tests with coverage report:

```bash
pytest -v
```

## Future Improvements

- Add a **users module** to enable user login so that each user can have their own notes.
- Implement more advanced text analysis features.
- Add tagging and categorization for notes.
